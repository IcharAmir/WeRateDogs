# WeRateDogs
For this project, I wrangled data thatâ€™s associated with tweets of Twitter user "WeRateDogs". The dataset is based on three individual sets being provided by different sources:
a- A twitter archive dataset containing tweet data directly from the user. This dataset is being provided as a download.
b- An image prediction dataset containing information about the dog breeds. This dataset is being hosted on a server and should be downloaded programmatically.
c- A dataset containing retweet and favorite counts of tweets. This dataset needs to be created based on a request to the Twitter API.
The goal is to wrangle all datasets to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
